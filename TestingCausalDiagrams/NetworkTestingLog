------ TEST 1 -------

Got these warnings:

Warning messages:
1: lavaan->lav_data_full():  
   some ordered categorical variable(s) have more than 12 levels: "Age" 
2: lavaan->lav_data_full():  
   some observed variances are (at least) a factor 1000 times larger than others; use varTable(fit) to investigate 
3: lavaan->lav_samplestats_step2():  
   correlation between variables Education and BMI is (nearly) 1.0 

Addressed last two by scaling numeric data with following code:
# Scale Numeric Variables to std=1
d$BMI <- scale(d$BMI)
d$MentHlth <- scale(d$MentHlth)
d$PhysHlth <- scale(d$PhysHlth)

Addressed first problem by treating age as numeric data to avoid 13 categories
d$Age <- as.numeric(d$Age)



Initial Testing with 1 conditioning variable

Two biggest problems
1. DiffW _||_ Incm
2. MntH _||_ PhyH | AnyH

Fix by drawing arrows
1. Income -> DiffW (Low money prevents people from getting health care for leg problems?)
2. PhyH <-> MntH (bidirectional)


------ TEST 2 -------

1 Conditioning Variable
Largest Problems
1. DffW _||_ PhyA | Incm
2. Age _||_ Dffw
3. DiffW _||_ MntH |AnyH
4. Frts _||_ Vggs | Edct
 

Fix by drawing arrows
1. PhyA <-> DiffW (not sure about this, seems like it could be a bi-directional arrow, implicit latent variable?)
2. Age -> DiffW
3. DiffW -> MntH
3. Frts <-> Vggs (should be bi-directional, underlying latent variable)

------ TEST 3 -------

0 Conditioning Variables (Probably should have done this first)
Largest problems
1. Edct _||_ Smkr
2. GnHI _||_ Smkr

Both seem reasonable so to fix
1. Edct -> Smkr
2. Smkr -> GnHI

------ TEST 4 -------

Conditioning on 1
largest problem
1. Age _||_ Incm

Add arrow
1. Age -> Incm
2. Age -> GenHlth

------ TEST 5 -------
Looks good

Some additional things to do if time permits
1. Test for surplus arrows
2. Test for arrows in the wrong direction
3. Introduce better latent variables (instead of bi-directional arrows)
